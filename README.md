# Personal Blocklist

Very biased and prone to breakage blocklist(s). Intended to be used with the mainstream lists and not standalone.

[main](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alliegaytor/blocklist/main/main) should work fine and includes things other filter lists might miss. I won't add things here if I am not sure it won't break anything important.

[windows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alliegaytor/blocklist/main/windows) is a potentially breaking list that I'm working on. It should be used in conjunction with [WindowsSpyBlocker](https://github.com/crazy-max/WindowsSpyBlocker). Currently not really tested as I don't use windows.

There are some other hosts / allowlists in [misc](./misc).
